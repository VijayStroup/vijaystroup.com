BLASTOFF
========

Overview
--------
BlastOff is a graphical user interface for viewing rocket sensors during the
launch phase of a rocket. The incoming data is just simulated without real sensors
and the graphical user interface is representative of that data. The "fake" sensors
record the data of the rocket's thrust, velocity, air pressure, altitude, and
temperature.
