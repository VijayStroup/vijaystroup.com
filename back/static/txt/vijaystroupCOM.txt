VIJAYSTROUP.COM
===============

Overview
--------
vijaystroup.com is my personal website. This is a central hub where all my projects are located
and ways in which to get in contact with me.
With the combination of not being a good graphic designer and having a technical background, the
best solution I thought of for my website was a design that simulated a terminal emulator.

Language(s) & Unique Features
-----------------------------
- Python, JavaScript(Vanilla, NodeJS, ReactJS), HTML, CSS, JSON

- Flask for handling backend web configuration.
- Python and javascript(vanilla) interaction for cli.
- Simulated terminal emulator.
- Python Flask serving ReactJS for frontend.
