DISNEY
======

Overview
--------
This project was my introduction to data science. In this project, I did many different
plots and reports with data such as Disney's movie's revenue, and Disney Parks' ride waiting
time. In the end, I made algorithm which asks for a users input, and will return the best
route they should take through a Disney Park to minimize line waiting time. 

Language(s) & Unique Features

- Python

- Many charts and plots showing the data visually.
- Reports based on the data.
- Algorithm to find the best route at a certain Disney Park to minimize line waiting time.
