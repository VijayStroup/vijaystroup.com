MARKETWATCH
===========

Overview
--------
This project came about with a problem I was having. I wanted to invest in the stock
market when the S&P500 dropped - in the day - 2% or more. Instead of having to constantly
check myself, I wrote a program that checks the current price of the day, and if it meets
the 2% threshold, will send me a text message. I then set up a cronjob to run the script
every hour, thus achieving complete autonomy.

Language(s) & Unique Features
-----------------------------
- Python

- Sending text messages with google's smtp server.
